# A Python generator is a special kind of function that lets you produce a sequence of values lazily — 
# meaning it generates each value only when needed instead of building the entire list in memory.

# This makes generators great for:
# Handling large datasets without memory issues
# Creating infinite sequences
# Writing cleaner, more readable code compared to manual iteration logic
